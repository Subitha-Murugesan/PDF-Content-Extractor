# 📄 PDF Content Extractor
A powerful Python script that extracts content from PDF files based on structured section headers. 
It is ideal for parsing reports, research papers, or documents with a clear outline format.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Extracts text between two headers in a PDF
- ✅ Normalizes and cleans the extracted text
- ✅ Supports recursive sub-section extraction
- ✅ Saves cleaned sections and logs problematic ones
- ✅ Outputs in `.txt` and `.pkl` formats

## Getting Started
## 🧠 Usage Example

Edit `main function` to specify your PDF file path:

```python
from extract_pdf import extract_main_sections_from_outline, process_subsections_recursive

pdf_path = "your_file.pdf"
main_sections = extract_main_sections_from_outline(pdf_path)

for i in range(len(main_sections) - 1):
    process_subsections_recursive(pdf_path, main_sections[i], main_sections[i + 1])
```

Outputs are saved in the `output/` directory.

## 🧾 Sample Output

**combined\_content\_save.txt**

```text
Section Title
-----------------------------
Cleaned content of this section...
```

**exceeds.txt**

```text
SectionTitle | Length | No subsections
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can adjust the length limit for section content in `extract_pdf.py`:

```python
section_split_threshold = 15000  # default value
```
